> 🚀 A lightweight, high-performance immutability library for JavaScript objects.

## ✨ Features

- **Blazing Fast**: Fastest in class — wins all benchmarks against immer, mutative, structura, and craft.
- **Zero Dependencies**: No runtime dependencies. Pure structural-sharing engine.
- **Simple API**: Write mutable-like syntax, get immutable results.
- **Structural Sharing**: Only copies the changed spine — unchanged branches are reused by reference.
- **Map & Set Support**: Full draft support for `Map` and `Set` — deep modifications, iteration, and structural sharing.
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety with `Draft<T>` and `Immutable<T>` (deep readonly).
- **Async Support**: `immutateAsync` for async recipes.

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
# npm
npm install @opentf/immutate

# pnpm
pnpm add @opentf/immutate

# bun
bun add @opentf/immutate
```

## 📖 Usage

`immutate` allows you to write code that looks like you are mutating your data, but it actually returns a new immutable version of it.

### Basic Example

```javascript
import { immutate } from '@opentf/immutate';

const baseState = {
  todo: 'Learn Immutate',
  done: false
};

const nextState = immutate(baseState, (draft) => {
  draft.done = true;
});

console.log(baseState.done); // false
console.log(nextState.done); // true
```

### Complex Updates

```javascript
const users = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Alice', active: true },
  { id: 2, name: 'Bob', active: false }
];

const updatedUsers = immutate(users, (draft) => {
  draft[1].active = true;
  draft.push({ id: 3, name: 'Charlie', active: true });
});
```

### Resetting State (Return Pattern)

You can replace the entire state by returning a value from the recipe.

```javascript
const initialState = { count: 0 };
const state = { count: 100 };

const resetState = immutate(state, (draft) => {
  if (shouldReset) {
    return initialState;
  }
  draft.count++;
});
```

### Async Recipe

```javascript
const nextState = await immutateAsync(state, async (draft) => {
  const data = await fetchData();
  draft.items = data;
});
```

### TypeScript Support

Immutate provides full type safety out of the box. It uses `Draft<T>` to make the draft mutable inside the recipe, and `Immutable<T>` to enforce **compile-time immutability** on the returned state.

This approach provides protection without the performance penalty of runtime `Object.freeze`.

```typescript
import { immutate, type Immutable } from '@opentf/immutate';

interface State {
  user: { name: string };
}

const state: State = { user: { name: 'John' } };

const nextState = immutate(state, (draft) => {
  draft.user.name = 'Jane'; // ✅ Draft is mutable
});

// nextState is Immutable<State>
// nextState.user.name = 'Bob'; // ❌ TS Error: Cannot assign to 'name' because it is a read-only property.
```

## 🛡️ Safety & Best Practices

To maintain peak performance, Immutate prioritizes speed over runtime checks. Follow these guidelines to ensure state integrity:

### 1. Never Leak the Draft
The `draft` object is only valid **inside** the recipe function. Never assign it to a variable outside the recipe.

```typescript
let leaked;
immutate(state, (draft) => {
  leaked = draft; // ❌ BAD: Never do this
});
// leaked is still a "live" Proxy, but using it here can lead to memory leaks and bugs.
```

### 2. Only Mutate the Draft
Do not attempt to mutate the `baseState` directly while inside a recipe. Always perform your changes on the `draft`.

### 3. Return vs. Mutation
You can either mutate the draft **OR** return a new value. If you return a value (other than `undefined`), it will completely replace the state, and any mutations made to the draft will be ignored.

### 4. Async Caution
When using `immutateAsync`, ensure that you don't have multiple overlapping async recipes modifying the same state from different places, as this can lead to classic race conditions (this is a general async state rule, not specific to Immutate).

### 5. Date Objects
Immutate does not proxy `Date` objects due to internal slot limitations in JavaScript. Treat Dates as **immutable primitives**: instead of calling `.setFullYear()`, replace the property with a new Date instance.

```typescript
immutate(state, (draft) => {
  // ❌ draft.date.setFullYear(2025); (Will throw TypeError)
  draft.date = new Date("2025-01-01"); // ✅ Correct
});
```

## ⚡ Benchmarks

Compared against popular immutability libraries. All libraries pass correctness verification before benchmarking. Lower avg time is better.

> **Environment**: Bun v1.3.12 — 5,000 iterations per test (with warmup).

<sup>¹ Immer discourages async inside `produce`; requires `createDraft`/`finishDraft` workaround.</sup>
<sup>² Structura supports standard patches via `enableStandardPatches(true)`.</sup>
<sup>³ Mutative auto-freeze is disabled by default for performance; opt-in via `enableAutoFreeze`.</sup>
<sup>⁴ Structura freezes at compile-time via TypeScript only, not at runtime.</sup>
<sup>⁵ Mutative detects circular references only when `enableAutoFreeze` is enabled in development mode.</sup>
<sup>⁶ Immer requires calling `enableMapSet()` to enable Map/Set support.</sup>
<sup>⁷ Mutative supports class instances via custom `mark` function.</sup>
<sup>⁸ Immutate uses deep-readonly TypeScript types to enforce immutability at compile-time with zero runtime overhead.</sup>
